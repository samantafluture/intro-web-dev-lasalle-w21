        <h2>A little introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Samanta Gimenez Fluture</strong> and I'm from <em>Sao Paulo, Brazil</em>. <br> This is my first semester studying Computer Science at LaSalle College. I'm really enjoying Montreal so far. Although it's freezing, it can be beautiful :) I also really enjoy taking long walks and hiking. I've been to the top of Mount Royal and it's amazing.</p>
